1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction that mentions [AUDIENCE-TAKES-SHOW] and mayby a bit
   of context/history and motivation for this doc that will update/patch
   [RFC7523], [RFC7522], and [RFC9126].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The Updates

3.1.  JWT Client Authentication

   aud must solely contain the authorization server's issuer identifier.

   Explicit typing of the Client Authentication JWT as a good thing to
   do in general but also allowing for observerability and controle
   during the transition period.

3.2.  SAML Client Authentication

   This hasn't been used in practice and this document will say not to
   ever use it going forward.

3.3.  Assertion Based Authorization Grants

   Advise client to ensure that the audience of the assertion makes
   sense with respect to where it’s being sent, which might Token
   endpoint URL, Issuer Identifier, SAML Entity ID.

4.  Security Considerations

   This specification tightens assertion audience handling directives as
   a mitigation for potential attacks arising from the exploitation of
   ambiguities in authorization server identification allowed by
   [RFC7523], [RFC7522], [RFC7521], and compounded by [RFC9126].

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  OAuth URI Registry Updates

   IANA is requested to update the "OAuth URI" registry
   [IANA.OAuth.Parameters] for the following entriest to add [[this
   specfication]] as an addtional refernce:

   *  urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer

   *  urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:jwt-bearer

   *  urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer

   *  urn:ietf:params:oauth:client-assertion-type:saml2-bearer

5.2.  Media Type Registration

   Registration is requested for the following media type in the IANA
   "Media Types" registry [IANA.MediaTypes] in the manner described in
   [RFC6838].

   TODO for application/client-authentication+jwt
